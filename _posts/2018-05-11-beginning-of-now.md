Hello there!

I finally started building my personal website! My first webdev experience was in Yr10 highschool around 2011. I used HTML to host flash games on my school's server as the school network blocked most sites.

Heads up, bit long and personal.
A few important things to say. I am 21 years old now and my main goal is to pursue post-grad in Stanford University. In pursuit of this goal, I am certain the journey will be both meaningful and enriching to me no matter the final outcome.
Looking back during national service (2y3m) in Singapore, I've experienced the power in devoting my whole being towards a goal. Those days of extreme time-management of 5 minute blocks and keeping the key principal of "meet the timings". 
As an officer, I was taught the power of precedence. We're told "Once you achieved this standard, you can never fall below it. You must either maintain or improve.".
What does that mean? Well, take it this way. If you perform with your best effort, integrity and a positive attitude; you will set a precedence. In future, when it counts, you will be able to perform outstandingly as you have set the minimum standard as your best.

This is very real to me. Another thing I note, it's scary how easily one can bring ruin to one's self. A moment of procrastination. A moment of weakness. That's all it takes to fall on a journey.
A goal is a fight. A battle.
This year I hope to explore machine learning, secure high distinctions in all my units and launch my own start-up. With small efforts each day.
This is a period of growth. I have energy and I'll make the time.
I hope to continuously open doors of opportunity, meet new people and keep challenging myself to grow in character. I have a long term goal. It's pretty simple. To be a good man, son, friend and husband. 
God bless.

I am pretty weird and I enjoy sharing stories with people. Everyone has one. If you would like to have a chat one day, hit me up!

Cheers,
Joey
